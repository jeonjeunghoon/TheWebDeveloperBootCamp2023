			The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated jungle <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
			species
			such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
			term
			for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
			adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens
			primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred
			for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.

			Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
			Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
			subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in Egypt in the
			mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and
			Shinar,
			Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.
